# Web-Boilerplate
This is a template for you to use at the start of a new web project.
Although this might be helpful for projects using libraries, it was made for vanilla (stardard HTML5, CSS3, & JS) projects.

I made this because I was annoyed by conflicting CSS properties that are built-in but not declared by the developer. 
The real benefit is that all of the default CSS properties (that I could find, with this current version) are visible to you.



# Do I need to worry about licences or Copyright?
No, do whatever you want with this. I'm obviously not responsible for any bad decisions you make with this.



# How Should I use this?
You can:
 - Copy the whole thing and put your own code in as you work, like I do
 - Use it as a reference, to see what default values are in case you lose track
 - Copy and paste only the parts you need



# Is this everything?
No, I'm certain there are things I have missed and different browsers have their own built-in elements.



# Will you continue to update this?
I use this as a personal boilerplate, I will update it if I feel like it's missing something. You are always welcome to make suggestions or ask for new things to be included, but I make no promises.
